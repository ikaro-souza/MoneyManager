# MoneyManager
In this application the user has to first create an account, then he's able to create expenses wich are separated into 3 categories:
  - Normal: an sporadic purchase like buying a cheeseburguer.
  - Fixed: things you constantly have to pay like mortgage, eletric and water bills, etc.
  - In Installments: as the name suggests, theses are purchases in installments.
  
This was a project from my Data Structures course back in mid 2018, i din't know much abou Java programming but i was able to find away to almost finish this project since there are still missing parts and bugs but i learnt a lot from it.

Things i learnt:
  - Why you need to split the frontend development from the backend.
  - How to use the Date and Calendar classes.
  - How to setup your own database using text file.
And some other things i can't remember right now.
